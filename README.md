# SOHCAHTOA

Small app I made when giving a mini-tutorial teaching React.js to a student of mine. We coded it along together in a video call lesson.

Useful for anyone who wants to practise their trig-values in degrees or radians. Please do not try this out on mobile phone, you will be horrified as I did not have the time to teach responsive CSS.

Try it out here (on desktop, remember) : https://sohcahtoa.vercel.app/
